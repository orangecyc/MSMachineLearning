Set up two environments: Microsoft R Server, Client PC

On Microsoft R Server:
1) R - Base R and R package
2) Microsoft R Open - with optimised script ScaleR package (with suffix rx-) which allows parallel run and handle XDF files

Microsoft R Server can be installed from MS SQL Server 2016


On Client PC:
1) IDE - Visual Studio Enterprise (already contains ScaleR package)/ RStudio
2) Microsoft R Open (with ScaleR package, can script to run in local PC or run in server) [https://mran.microsoft.com/download]
3) R Client (Contain a old version of R Open, must install if use RStudio) [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/machine-learning-server/r-client/install-on-windows]

Suggested installation step:
R Client -> R Open -> RStudio (Install RStudio first, still can detect Microsoft R. If cannot detect,  change Tools > Global Options > General > R version)
Visual Studio Enterprise:
R Tools -> Data Science Setting...
File -> Open -> File (Lab files in E: drive, same as those download of MOC content)
Note the console > = Local, remote> = On server


To run script on server:
1) Remote login to MS R Server - open a remote session 
2) "Pause" to return to local session
3) Put local object (a dataset/ script) to MS R Server
4) "Resume" to remote session
5) Run
6) exit to logout from remote R session

ScaleR:
Handle XDF files
Performance tuning - manage RAM loading and harddisk storage
Connect to Hadoop, Spark


MS SQL server:
Has R
